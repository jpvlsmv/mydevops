mydevops
========
A repository to record and share how I am setting up Vagrant, Docker, and CFEngine to manage my server and service infrastructure.

Goal
--------
Policies and Processes for setting up and maintaining service containers on physical and virtual resources

Why?
--------
I'm putting together 3 pieces of software that are hard to understand, and hard to make work together.  This repo will probably not have much working code either.
