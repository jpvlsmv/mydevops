This is a VM I needed once to demonstrate to my ISP that the sucky
performance was caused by their equipment dropping many, many packets
somewhere between "the other end of the telephone line" and the internet.

The problem will not be solved by rebooting my router, nor by dispatching a
tech to check the signal strength.
