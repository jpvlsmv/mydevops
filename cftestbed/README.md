Vagrant environment for testing and developing cfengine policies.

Download cfengine-nova-hub*.deb from cfengine.com (watch their licensing) and mkdir cfengine.

The setup is automated via the Makefile now.  Review and understand what the targets are doing (they're in order) or just run "make all" if you're crazy^Wadventurous.
